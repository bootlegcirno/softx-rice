# SoftX rice made by bootlegcirno

# Install guide

- Install ~~[BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)~~ (please use Vencord) or [Vencord](https://vencord.dev)
- Download SoftX.theme.css (for horizontal screens) or SoftXVertical.theme.css (for vertical screens) and copy to ~/themes in your ~~BetterDiscord or~~ Vencord install
- (optional) Go to Backup & Restore -> Import Settings -> settings.json
- Go to Settings -> Themes -> Enable SoftX
- If you use GameActivityToggle, the theme should work instantly, if you don't, you should tinker around.


# TODO:
- ~~Integrate GameActivityToggle~~ (should be fixed now)
